This directory contains specifications and architectural proposals for A2UI Macros and type-safe catalog builders.

## Active proposals

- [Programmatic macros and type-safe catalog builders](macros_and_typesafe_builders.md): Comprehensive proposal detailing the concept of macros, code generation architecture via `@a2ui/cli`, Python fluent builder API, catalog JSON ingestion in `@a2ui/web_core`, and the macro runtime engine.
- [Pydantic models for A2UI fluent builders and AST deserialization](pydantic_fluent_builders_and_deserialization.md): Detailed specification for generating Pydantic v2 component models, open enums, strict authoring validation, lossless round-tripping, and single-pass schema-aware AST deserialization.
